It is 5 AM and you have a paper due in 3 hours. After staying up all night, you have only managed to type up 5 pages of the 8 page requirement, and you are beginning to run out of ideas. Never fear, Text Inflator is here to save your sanity. Text Inflator is a tool that expands the length of a block of writing without adding any additional meaning. Simply paste your paper, essay, report, article, speech, paragraph, or any other block of English writing below and choose a desperation setting. A higher desperation setting will expand your essay much more than a smaller one, but will make your writing much more verbose sounding. Text Inflator adds unnecessary modifiers to adjectives and verbs, uses larger words and phrases in place of smaller ones, and repeats parts of sentences. For the best results, it is recommended that the user inputs grammatically correct paragraphs without spelling mistakes. Although this tool will make your essay, paragraph, or paper longer, it would make it much worse. It is not recommended that this be used for a formal, graded assignment, except possibly in the most extreme of circumstances with a low desperation setting. We are not responsible for lower grades or demoralizing remarks from your teachers or professors about how bad your writing is.
